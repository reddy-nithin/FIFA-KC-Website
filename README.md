## What This Is

Kansas City is the smallest metro ever to host a men's World Cup — and the only host city in the 2026 tournament with three FIFA Pot 1 national teams based here simultaneously (Argentina, England, Netherlands). That combination of small market, big event, and unique base camp distinction makes KC a genuinely interesting analytical subject.

This site visualizes the key research from the companion blog post in an interactive format. It is not a live data pipeline — the data is static and research-based, last updated February 2026. The goal is clarity, not complexity: make the numbers explorable without requiring someone to read 3,000 words first.
